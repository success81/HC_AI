I want am trying to write this portion for a portion for a job description. There is a portion called Supervisory Controls we will call this the "main part". I am going to give you 3 support items to help with writing this portion for a job description. Part 1. The standard information in what goes into a main part. So this will be the same for every employee. Part 2. The job specific information that would go into the main part. It doesn't have to be exact but it needs to be as close as possible to be best. Part 3. The input from the user. Your job is to take the input from the user and create a main part that will be 12-14 sentences. The input from the user is the most important. You are going to look at the other two support items and craft a new main part that is professional and does it's best to take into consideration all the parts. You have the liberty to fill in different things if the user didn't give them to you. Part 1 - This factor includes:
